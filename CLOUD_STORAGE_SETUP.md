I am applying to the PACFAIE AI Ethics Summer School 2025 because its theme—“AI Accountability and Corporate Governance”—speaks directly to the questions I confront every day as an African AI engineer building fintech and public-interest systems. My current projects include a QR-code mobile-money platform (Tinda) and a model-monitoring pipeline for large-language models deployed in healthcare triage chatbots. Both operate in high-stakes domains where an opaque recommendation or a biased credit-scoring threshold can block someone’s salary, delay medical help, or amplify existing inequalities.

The Summer School’s deep dive into risk and impact assessment, board-level AI oversight, explainability, algorithmic audits, and regulatory compliance will equip me with rigorous frameworks for auditing our models and presenting governance road-maps to regulators and investors

In return, I will bring a practitioner’s lens on the unique data, infrastructure, and policy realities of the DR Congo and Senegalese markets—contexts that are often missing from global AI ethics conversations.

Beyond the technical content, PACFAIE’s commitment to a diverse, interdisciplinary cohort—especially voices from under-represented regions mirrors my own mission to democratize access to responsible AI skills across Central Africa

I intend to translate the insights gained into (i) an open-source checklist for algorithmic accountability tailored to African fintech; (ii) a series of community workshops for local startups and university labs; and (iii) policy briefs for financial regulators outlining measurable governance benchmarks.

In short, the Summer School offers the exact mix of scholarship, peer exchange, and practical tools I need to ensure that the systems I help build are not only innovative, but also transparent, fair, and truly accountable to the communities they serve.
